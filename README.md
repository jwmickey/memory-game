Memory Game!
============

This is the classic card-flip memory game.  Flip two cards at a time to try to
match the same cards.  If the two cards do not match, they will flip back over
and you'll have to try again.  Once you match all cards the game is over and
you will receive a score.  

Points are awarded based on how many times each card is flipped:

* One Flip: 10 Points
* Two Flips: 5 Points
* Three Flips: 3 Points
* Four or More Flips: -5 Points

You can play this directly in the browser or add it to your 
iPhone or Android home screen - even play offline!

This project started in 2014 when React was a wee baby, so 
the list of people involved in the libraries that make this possible 
is far longer, but I can't bring myself to remove the thank-yous 
that helped me get started.
